##A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units.
##A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. 
##Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.
